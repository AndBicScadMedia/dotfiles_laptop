Hello Morgan!  Hope you are doing well out on the "warm coast"!  Here on 
the "cold coast" things are, well, COLD!  I suppose we chose to live 
here so I can't really complain.

I'd like to thank you once again for the great youtube videos. While I 
haven't stuck with Gentoo, I have gone a lot further with Awesome.  I 
posted a scrot of my awesome desktop using debian sid on my google+ 
page.  (jedsdesk)

HA, does that look familiar?  It is a great copy of the awesome setup 
your using on your Gentoo videos.  Getting it to work on Sid was a 
challenge to say the least.  Had to download the tarball and build 3.5.6 
from source.  Fun!

Anyway, thanks for the great setup!  I have poured over the interwebs 
looking at different folks rc.lua files and yours is far and away the 
nicest looking one I've yet to see.  I do have some questions.  I have 
been unable to get the wireless signal indicator widget at top right to 
display anything other than the red icon indicating no signal.  I have 
managed to get it to display a green 'On'.  I'm connected using wicd, 
not network manager.  Also, no VPN.  I've gone through the rc/wi.lua 
files as well as some of the ~/.config/awesome/vicous/widgets lua files 
to no avail.  Same with the /lain directory at that location.  Have yet 
to figure out the yawn weather city_id placement to get that working as 
well.

I've also had some issues with having to reboot to get sound to work, 
i.e. plugging in headphones then unplugging them, I lose touch with 
sound completely.  Still looking into this one.  I'm a tester/dev for a 
small distro called VSIDO that is based on Debian SID.  (shameless plug 
- vsido.org or my personal site where we host our ISO's - 
nixnut.com/vsido)  We recently switched our installer to Refracta from 
Remastersys.  Refracta is adamantly opposed to systemd.  (we're a Debian 
based distro, so they kinda made the decision for us.)  It, (refracta) 
relies instead on systemd-shim, and this in turn causes issues with 
dbus.  Dbus is absolutely working, just has issues with systemd trying 
to talk to it.

OK, I'll cut it there!  I could go on, but I'm having fun figuring most 
of it out on my own.  I've noticed you hang in freenode's #gentoo 
channel on IRC.  I have a personal channel on OFTC's network called 
#nixnut, and can also always be found in the #vsido channel on the same 
network.  Be an honor to type at ya sometime.

Thanks for everything,
Jed
